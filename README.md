**"A Novel Framework for Adsorption Thermodynamics: Combining Standardized Methodology with Machine Learning-based Text Classification"**

This repository contains the implementation of the machine learning-based text classification component described in the above paper. The classifier is designed to assist in selecting the appropriate theoretical framework for adsorption thermodynamics based on textual input.

It distinguishes between the following three adsorption system assumptions:

- **Classical Closed System**
- **Polanyi Open System**
- **Modern Open System**

## üöÄ Features

- TF-IDF + Naive Bayes classification pipeline
- Paragraph-level data expansion for small sample learning
- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) for rigorous evaluation
- Optional independent test set evaluation
- Confidence scoring and detailed probability output
- Reusable classification function

## üß™ Example: Classifying a Sample

```python
from atml_text_classifier import classify_text

text = "The adsorption equilibrium behavior suggests a partially open system ..."
label, confidence = classify_text(text, print_details=True)

print(f"Predicted Class: {label}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.4f}")

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

**Tested with:**
- Python ‚â• 3.8  
- scikit-learn ‚â• 1.3  
- NumPy ‚â• 1.22

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure the following files are in the working directory:
- `s1.txt`, `s2.txt`, `s3.txt` ‚Äì for training
- *(Optional)* `test.txt` ‚Äì for external evaluation

**Test file format**:
```
sample text | true label
```
or tab-separated:
```
sample text <TAB> true label
```

Run the model:

```bash
python atml_text_classifier.py
```
