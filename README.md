# üß† ATML Text Classifier

**"A Novel Framework for Adsorption Thermodynamics: Combining Standardized Methodology with Machine Learning-based Text Classification"**

This repository contains the implementation of the machine learning-based text classification component described in the above paper. The classifier is designed to assist in selecting the appropriate theoretical framework for adsorption thermodynamics based on textual input.

It distinguishes between the following three adsorption system assumptions:

- **Classical Closed System**
- **Polanyi Open System**
- **Modern Open System**

## üß™ Example: Classifying a Sample

```python
from atml_text_classifier import classify_text

text = "The adsorption equilibrium behavior suggests a partially open system ..."
label, confidence = classify_text(text, print_details=True)

print(f"Predicted Class: {label}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.4f}")
```python
